MERN Stack App Practice 1 

This is my continuation of learning JS and creating a full stack app. Intially I did HTML, CSS and JS vanilla. Then Express and node in the backend. This next step uses MongoDB Express React and Node. This is still a recipe app but it now has more features and many more libraries to help improve the quality of the application.
